# Core mods: changes to Hermes's own source

These are the changes I carry on my fork of
[NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). They can't be plugins
(or weren't, yet), so they ship here two ways:

- **`patches/`**: `git format-patch` output of every commit, numbered in apply order (`git am`-ready).
- **One doc per feature**: what it does, how it works, the code that matters, tests, how to apply it
  and the gotchas. It's written so your coding agent can re-implement the feature on a newer upstream
  when a patch no longer applies.

Keyboard shortcuts are summarized in [../shortcuts.md](../shortcuts.md).

## Features

| Doc | Patches | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| [archive-linked-confirm.md](archive-linked-confirm.md) | 0110 | Archiving a chat with open Kanban tasks or rented machines asks first, listing them; plugins add checks via `ctx.registerArchiveGuard` |
| [screen-share.md](screen-share.md) | 0109 | Inline Screen Share plugin opens strictly validated VNC addresses on the client Desktop OS, never the remote gateway |
| [session-navigation-shortcuts.md](session-navigation-shortcuts.md) | 0019 0021 0022 0026 0033 0035 0043 0048 0049 0050 0065 | ⌘]/⌘[ next/prev session with a green/red status stripe (stepping from the focused tab), ⌘B mark blocked (grey, skipped), ⌘⇧]/⌘⇧[ any session, ⌘⇧A archive-and-advance, ⌘R resume (⌥⌘R in 0064–0070), ⌥⇧⌘R window reload |
| [ai-session-rename.md](ai-session-rename.md) | 0020 0032 0042 | ⌘⇧E rename (was ⌘⇧N until 0042), pre-filled with an AI short name (`session.title.suggest` RPC) |
| [project-palette.md](project-palette.md) | 0004 0018 0030 0061 | ⌘⇧P moves a session to a project by typeahead (a new name offers "Create project" with an empty `~/code/<slug>`); typing a project name in ⌘P lists "Move to project: <name>" |
| [multi-gateway-projects.md](multi-gateway-projects.md) | 0023 0024 0025 0028 0029 0031 0054 0101 | Sidebar shows every connected gateway's projects (colored, with show/hide toggles); move a session into any gateway's project; archive on the owning gateway; `@session` ref clicks open on the owning gateway |
| [sidebar-status-stripe.md](sidebar-status-stripe.md) | 0038 0039 0044 0051 0063 0070 0089 0091 0094 0095 0099 0104 0124 | Sidebar row stripe shows status (green = done, waiting on you; red = stuck), never green while its Kanban tasks, `/goal` or a live background process are still running (project-mode rows past the recents page included) (and the backend no longer reaps a detached session whose background job still runs); a session that owns a live cron job shows a grey loop glyph and is skipped like a parked row; the row shows open/blocked Kanban task counts and a laptop / Mac mini / cloud glyph for the owning gateway; the travelling arc marks only the selected row |
| [new-chat-gateway-hotkeys.md](new-chat-gateway-hotkeys.md) | 0042 | ⌘N starts the new chat on This device (switches the gateway to local); ⌘⇧N keeps the selected gateway |
| [persistent-new-session-draft.md](persistent-new-session-draft.md) | 0036 | ⌘N returns to the unsent new-session draft (text + attachments) instead of an empty composer |
| [session-takeover.md](session-takeover.md) | 0013 0014 0015 0060 | "Take over here" for a chat that's live in another Hermes window, naming the machine that holds it; a hidden chat's agent keeps its Browser page |
| [auto-continue-resume.md](auto-continue-resume.md) | 0008 0010 | `desktop.auto_continue.resume_on_startup`: interrupted sessions resume when the backend boots, including turns cut off by a backend shutdown |
| [fork-updates-and-relaunch.md](fork-updates-and-relaunch.md) | 0007 0011 0012 0016 0066 | **Start here if you'll carry patches.** `updates.fork_merge_upstream` lets `hermes update` merge upstream into your fork. Also: the app relaunches after a headless rebuild, `hermes serve --stop` spares Desktop's backend, no "Switch to This device?" prompt, and `HERMES_DESKTOP_PREBUILT_APP` installs a prebuilt app instead of packing |
| [macos-signed-python.md](macos-signed-python.md) | 0017 0027 0123 0142 | macOS: run Hermes from a Developer-ID-signed Python.app, so Full Disk Access, Accessibility and other permission grants survive Python upgrades; a bare `python3` in terminal commands and cron scripts runs the signed bundle too, and the bundle (not `osascript`) owns the launchd gateway job, so permission prompts name Hermes Python |
| [kanban-board-hotkey.md](kanban-board-hotkey.md) | 0056 | ⌘⇧K opens the Kanban board; composer send-queued moves to ⌘⌥K |
| [kanban-drop-attachments.md](kanban-drop-attachments.md) | 0057 | Drag files from Finder onto a Kanban task card or open task dialog to attach them |
| [kanban-all-gateways.md](kanban-all-gateways.md) | 0090 | One Kanban board across every gateway: merged cards, a gateway filter, and device glyphs on cards; writes go to the owning gateway |
| [reload-backend-hotkey.md](reload-backend-hotkey.md) | 0064 0071 | ⇧⌘R restarts the backend and reloads the window, so core/plugin edits land without quitting the app; ⌘R is resume; forceReload on ⌥⇧⌘R |
| [kanban-toast-status-icon.md](kanban-toast-status-icon.md) | 0058 0062 | Kanban toast status icons and task-specific Open action; 0105 supersedes completion/blocked popups with quiet notifications and a persistent sidebar list |
| [owning-gateway-routing.md](owning-gateway-routing.md) | 0040 0041 0045 0046 0047 | With several gateways, opening a session, its tiles and its background RPCs all go to the gateway that owns it (following a 4007 to the right one) instead of opening an empty chat on the selected gateway |
| [kanban-session-links.md](kanban-session-links.md) | 0059 0067 0068 0092 0093 0111 0112 | Chats stay tied to the Kanban cards they create (including `hermes kanban create` from an agent terminal or execute_code) or shepherd: the cards show in the chat's Tasks view (listed by `GET /api/session-kanban-tasks`), its sidebar row stays busy until they land and turns red while one is blocked |
| [dashboard-cloudflare-access.md](dashboard-cloudflare-access.md) | 0037 | Opt-in: a verified Cloudflare Access login for an allowlisted email counts as a dashboard session, so you log in once |
| [tool-search-eager.md](tool-search-eager.md) | 0114 0120 | `tools.tool_search.eager` keeps chosen tools (plugin tools too) always visible instead of behind `tool_search`; `forward_direct_calls` runs a `tool_call` to a directly-listed tool instead of refusing |
| [kanban-timed-waits.md](kanban-timed-waits.md) | 0113 | Kanban workers park timed/external waits with `kanban_schedule`, so their chat isn't marked as needing you |
| [pre-verify-every-turn.md](pre-verify-every-turn.md) | 0052 | `agent.pre_verify_every_turn: true` runs the `pre_verify` plugin hook on every final answer, not only after file edits |
| [skills-review-fork-count.md](skills-review-fork-count.md) | 0055 0097 0128 | The background skill-review fork can patch a skill the session already loaded, as long as the loaded copy still matches the file on disk; a refused write hands back the current file so the next call is the corrected write |
| [process-readoption.md](process-readoption.md) | 0069 0072 0073 0076 0077 0085 | Background jobs stay in the shared `processes.json` while other Hermes processes run; after a Desktop restart the backend re-adopts the orphaned ones and wakes their chat when they exit, even one you haven't opened |
| [gateway-exit-diagnostics.md](gateway-exit-diagnostics.md) | 0074 0075 0081 | Gateway exit records carry an info/warning/error level, so routine restarts stop showing as errors; fewer false Slack/websocket errors; `hermes update` finds a gateway whose interpreter path has a space |
| [credential-pool-429-rotation.md](credential-pool-429-rotation.md) | 0078 | A 429 with a reset window over 60 s rotates to another pooled key right away instead of sleeping out the window |
| [account-limit-causes.md](account-limit-causes.md) | 0133 0134 0144 | An auxiliary 429 benches only the failed model on the failed key (billing/auth stay account-wide); pooled usage rows say why an account is limited (quota vs cooldown, reason, expiry, model-only cooldowns); a duplicate login's stale bench no longer paints a usable account red |
| [kanban-macos-worker-start-time.md](kanban-macos-worker-start-time.md) | 0079 0080 0117 | Live Kanban workers survive a gateway restart, sleep/wake or a macOS hostname change instead of being marked crashed and started again as duplicates; a retried run gets a bounded tail of the previous run's transcript |
| [update-external-supervisor.md](update-external-supervisor.md) | 0082 0083 0084 | `hermes update` leaves launchd-supervised gateways and dashboards for launchd to restart, instead of starting a racing copy |
| [session-lease-wake.md](session-lease-wake.md) | 0086 0087 0088 | Running turns survive laptop sleep (the lease is renewed on wake if nobody else claimed the session); a turn that really lost its session shows a "Hermes stopped this reply" card with Retry instead of silently stopping |
| [small-fixes.md](small-fixes.md) | 0001 0002 0003 0005 0006 0009 0053 | Completion sound "Off", sidebar chevron, no session preview cap, sleep isn't idleness, compression reload spares context engines, desktop-only plugin packages, full-width tab titles |
| [oauth-wire-tool-names.md](oauth-wire-tool-names.md) | 0096 | Resolve OAuth wire names inside tool_call/tool_describe without changing registered names or bridge restrictions |
| [memory-cap-headroom.md](memory-cap-headroom.md) | 0098 0125 | Show free characters near capacity and recommend consolidation with 10% headroom; unattended reviews get the live budget and the staging rule instead |
| [kanban-block-loop-escalation.md](kanban-block-loop-escalation.md) | 0100 | Keep block-loop escalations out of automatic decomposition until a later input event |
| [skill-write-feedback.md](skill-write-feedback.md) | 0102 0103 0116 | Skill size warnings, no-op success, and explicit stale-patch reload/atomic-batch retry guidance |
| [kanban-pr-unblock.md](kanban-pr-unblock.md) | 0115 | An explicit unblock after a PR comment releases the active-PR respawn guard |
| [kanban-blocked-sidebar.md](kanban-blocked-sidebar.md) | 0105 0107 0108 | Persistent blocked cards across boards/gateways, grouped by the chat managing them (0107), whose header opens that chat on its own gateway (0108); completions are silent, blocked events retain only away-only OS notifications |
| [session-tab-status-underline.md](session-tab-status-underline.md) | 0106 | Session tab underline uses the sidebar status-stripe color (green/red/grey; neutral for draft/running) |
| [hidden-preview-open.md](hidden-preview-open.md) | 0118 0119 | An agent in a chat you're not viewing (including another profile's) gets "opened" only once its preview page has actually loaded off screen, so its next read/act works and focusing the chat shows the same page |
| [kanban-soft-deadline.md](kanban-soft-deadline.md) | 0121 | Kanban workers near their runtime cap checkpoint with `kanban_continue` and a fresh run resumes from it instead of being killed and counted as a failure; long waits hand off with a wake time instead of polling |
| [kanban-worktree-validation.md](kanban-worktree-validation.md) | 0122 | `kanban_create` / `hermes kanban create` reject a worktree workspace that can never resolve, naming the fix; such a card blocks on its first spawn failure instead of burning retries |
| [turn-stop-notice.md](turn-stop-notice.md) | 0126 | A turn stopped from a client ends with a visible "Stopped by <login>" line, and the log names who sent the Stop |
| [kanban-open-task-hook.md](kanban-open-task-hook.md) | 0127 | `window.__hermesKanbanOpenTask(taskId, board?, gateway?)` lets disk plugins open a card's drawer on its own board and gateway |
| [review-evidence-gate.md](review-evidence-gate.md) | 0129 | `auxiliary.background_review.require_evidence` makes background skill review edit a skill only when a specific moment in the conversation justifies it; "Nothing to save." becomes a neutral outcome |
| [kanban-block-instructions.md](kanban-block-instructions.md) | 0130 | `kanban_block`'s `reason` asks for ask-first, numbered, concrete unblock steps (what the blocked-panel Desktop plugin shows above the composer) |
| [sidebar-row-actions.md](sidebar-row-actions.md) | 0131 | `SidebarSectionRow` takes hover-revealed `actions` and a `strong` (unread) label, for the inbox plugin's per-row Archive |
| [kanban-notice-refusal-rewind.md](kanban-notice-refusal-rewind.md) | 0132 | A Kanban notice whose turn is refused (`SESSION_NOT_OWNED`, chat open in two backends) is rewound for the owning backend instead of dropped |
| [kanban-goal-handoff-judge.md](kanban-goal-handoff-judge.md) | 0135 | Goal-mode handoff judge treats the `kanban_complete` / `kanban_request_review` call it gates as the card's "finish with" step, so such cards can reach review |
| [cron-bot-chat-busy-defer.md](cron-bot-chat-busy-defer.md) | 0136 | A Bot Chat cron delivery refused because another delivery holds the chat (`SESSION_NOT_OWNED` / `MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS`) is queued and posted once the chat frees, instead of being dropped |
| [tool-hook-order.md](tool-hook-order.md) | 0137, 0138 | `transform_tool_result` fires after `post_tool_call` on the sequential registry path too, so a hint queued in post lands on the same tool result instead of the next one |
| [account-usage-refresh-claims.md](account-usage-refresh-claims.md) | 0139 | Long-running backends keep refreshing pooled account usage: a refresh claim that leaks (thread start failure, a worker dying mid-batch) is released or expires after 60 s instead of showing every account `unknown` until restart; `diagnostics.account_usage_cache` RPC shows claim and snapshot ages |
| [kanban-complete-rejection-class.md](kanban-complete-rejection-class.md) | 0140 | Every `kanban_complete` refusal carries a stable `rejection` class (`goal_judge`, `phantom_cards`, `empty`, `stale_run`, ...) so digests count failed completions by cause |
| [kanban-shared-blockers.md](kanban-shared-blockers.md) | 0141 | Cards stopped by the same outside wall (CI billing, an outage) share a `blocker_id`: one card probes it every 30 min while the rest wait, and clearing it releases them all without a human |
| [review-wait-stripe.md](review-wait-stripe.md) | 0143 | A chat whose last reply links an open PR still waiting on review stripes red when the review is on you (or others were asked over 24 h ago), grey while only others were asked in the last 24 h |
| [tool-search-defer-outside-worker.md](tool-search-defer-outside-worker.md) | 0145 | `tools.tool_search.defer_outside_kanban_worker` defers the listed tools (the Kanban worker-lifecycle tools on the fork) in chats, cron and one-shots only; dispatcher-spawned Kanban workers keep them direct, saving ~3.7k tokens per call elsewhere |

## Applying

The patches touch shared files (keybind registry, i18n, sidebar, the RPC contract), so they are
**not independent**. Apply them in order, either all of them or a prefix up to the last one you
need. Revert what you don't want afterwards.

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-agent
git worktree add --detach ../hermes-mods-test 4957bbd0a0
cd ../hermes-mods-test
git am -3 ~/code/hermes-mods/core/patches/*.patch
```

Verified on October 17, 2026 (PT): all **127** patches applied cleanly with `git am -3`
in a detached worktree starting at merge-base `4957bbd0a0`. Start from that merge-base
(`git merge-base upstream/main origin/main` for this fork snapshot), not a newer
`upstream/main`; upstream changes can otherwise conflict with the early patches.

Each doc's **Applying** section describes its dependencies and verification limits.
The verified apply set here is the full ordered series; do not assume individual patches are independent.

If a later patch conflicts because upstream moved, re-implement it from its doc instead of forcing
the hunk. Each doc's **Code** and **Tests** sections are the spec.

## Building and running a patched Hermes

1. **Python changes** (`tui_gateway/`, `hermes_cli/`, `agent/`) take effect on the next process start:
   restart the gateway (`hermes gateway run`, or your launchd job) and the Desktop backend.
2. **Desktop changes** (`apps/desktop/`) need a rebuild:
   ```bash
   # macOS: sign it with your Developer ID, or the app is ad-hoc signed and macOS treats every
   # rebuild as a new app (permission grants reset, signature-checking launchers refuse it)
   APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
     CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=true hermes desktop --build-only --force-build
   ```
   That takes about 3 minutes. Quit and reopen Hermes.app afterwards. You can also set
   `desktop.macos_signing_identity` once so every rebuild is signed.
3. **Tests.** Python: `scripts/run_tests.sh <files>` from the repo root. A bare `venv/bin/python -m pytest`
   can fail on a missing `ruamel`. Desktop: `cd apps/desktop && npx vitest run <file>`; vitest needs a
   current Node (v18 is too old). `npm run typecheck` checks types, and `npx eslint --fix <files>` fixes
   import/prop sort lint. Run the tests each doc lists before you trust a rebased patch.
   When I last ran the full series (Oct 2026): every test the patches add or touch passes, lint has 0 errors,
   and tsc is clean. The rest of the desktop suite had 13 failures (`mac-sign`, `desktop-uninstall`,
   `remote-lifecycle`, native-deps and similar). Those fail the same way on the unpatched base on a Mac, so
   they're environment-dependent, not caused by these patches. One `hermes-bots/group-activity` test is flaky
   with or without the patches.

The 0096–0105 mirror verification (October 16, 2026 PT) applied all 105 patches cleanly
and passed all changed regression files: 197 Python tests across 8 files and 99 Desktop
tests across 7 files. This targeted run did not rerun the full suite or typecheck.

The 0117–0127 mirror verification (October 17, 2026 PT) applied all 127 patches cleanly
and passed every test file those patches add or touch: 195 Python tests across 16 files and
214 Desktop tests across 8 files. Again no full suite or typecheck.

The 0128–0129 mirror verification (October 18, 2026 PT) applied all 129 patches cleanly and
passed the changed test files: 92 Python tests across 3 files.

The 0130 mirror verification (October 18, 2026 PT) applied all 130 patches cleanly with `git am -3`
at merge-base `4957bbd0a0`; the patch's new schema test passes (and fails without it).

## Gotchas

- **`hermes update` drops uncommitted edits and resets to `origin`.** Keep the patches as commits on
  a fork you own, and set `updates.fork_merge_upstream: true` (patch 0007), so updates merge upstream
  into your commits. The first update after you adopt a fork still runs the *old* updater, which backs
  up and resets; that's fine once the fork contains upstream. Details are in
  [fork-updates-and-relaunch.md](fork-updates-and-relaunch.md).
- **`hermes update` stops a hand-started gateway or `hermes serve` and doesn't restart it.** Run
  anything you depend on as a supervised service (launchd `KeepAlive`).
- **Never run `hermes serve --stop` just to restart one server.** Without patch 0012 it also kills
  the Desktop app's own backend.
- **RPC contract.** Patches that add JSON-RPC methods or events also edit
  `apps/shared/src/gateway-contract.generated.ts` and `gateway-contract.openrpc.json`. If those
  conflict, regenerate them from the Python contracts (`tui_gateway/contracts/`) with
  `python scripts/gen_gateway_contracts.py`; don't hand-merge them.
- **i18n.** Every new UI string has to be translated in each `apps/desktop/src/i18n/*.ts` locale or
  listed in `overlay-gaps.json`, or `overlay-completeness.test.ts` fails. After changing `en.ts`, run
  `npm run i18n:keys` and commit `locales/_keys.desktop.json`.
- **Fix-up patches 0031–0034.** These close test and lint gaps in earlier patches. Take each one with the
  patch it fixes:

  | Patch | Fixes | Goes with |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0031 | translations for the `sidebar.filter.*` labels | 0024 |
  | 0032 | `session.title.suggest` wire contract + regenerated contract files | 0020 |
  | 0033 | import order lint in `use-desktop-integrations.ts` | 0022 |
  | 0034 | regenerated `locales/_keys.desktop.json` | 0019–0024 |
- **Keybinds.** The defaults live in `apps/desktop/src/lib/keybinds/actions.ts` and the handlers in
  `apps/desktop/src/app/hooks/use-keybinds.ts`. `actions.test.ts` rejects chord conflicts.
- **Tags.** I tag my commits `[daveey]` in the subject so they're easy to list
  (`git log upstream/main..origin/main`). Use your own tag.
