"""reply_check: look at the agent's final answer for a turn BEFORE the turn ends (pre_verify hook).

Three anti-patterns, measured in the user's own history (coach gap report 2026-10-14):
- handoff:     the agent hands the user a step it could plausibly do itself (click/log in/run/paste...).
- confirm:     the agent ends by asking permission for a reversible next step ("Want me to ...?").
- unverified:  the agent claims done/fixed/working without checking on the user's real path.

Layer 1 (here, zero latency) are cheap regex prefilters; Layer 2 is an LLM judge (aux task
`coach_reply`) that sees the user's ask, the turn's tool log and the reply. Only a judge verdict
at or above the threshold produces a nudge; the nudge goes back to the agent (the turn continues),
never to the user.

the agent to self-serve and to verify its own work. Judge ONLY from the evidence shown. Score three independent
probabilities (0-1):

- handoff: the message asks the USER to perform a step (click, sign in, run a command, paste, approve a dialog,
  restart an app, plug something in...) that the agent could plausibly have done itself with shell, browser
  automation, saved credentials, a password vault, a token broker, ssh, or background desktop control. Physical
  actions (plugging hardware, being at a device), the user's own judgment/taste, money/legal decisions, secrets
  only the user knows, and macOS privacy permission grants are NOT handoffs (score low).
- confirm: the message ends by asking permission for a next step that is reversible and clearly within what the
  user already asked for (e.g. "Want me to run the tests / apply the fix / commit it?"). Asking before something
  irreversible, external-facing (sending messages/emails, spending money, deleting data, force-push, publishing),
  or genuinely ambiguous in intent is NOT a needless confirm (score low). A plan presented for an explicit go
  when the user asked for a plan first is NOT needless.
- unverified: the message claims the work is done/fixed/working/deployed, but the turn's tool log shows no check
  that exercises the user's actual path (running the real command/app/URL/test the user cares about and seeing the
  right result). Building, type-checking, or testing something adjacent does not count. Saying explicitly that it
  is unverified or what remains unchecked is NOT an unverified claim (score low).

Calibrate: 0.8+ means you'd bet the user will push back ("do it yourself" / "just do it" / "you have access").
